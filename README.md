# Python-War-card-game
Server vs Player War card game

The game run's only on your own local network by getting your IPv4.
I used port #5555, you can change that if in use.

Features:
- Betting
- Player timeout (60 seconds)
- Play again
- The server Can support up to 3 players

To play:
1) Run server.py first and check that he is up.
2) run client.py to start a game session.

Check out the screenshot.ppt file for examples.
Will add the .exe files later on.
